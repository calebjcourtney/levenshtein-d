# Levenshtein Distance in D
A simple D implementation to calculate the Levenshtein distance for two strings. The D language already has an implementation in the standard library, but this is a simpler approach.

# Usage
You need to have D installed, and this is using Dub.

Clone the repo and navigate to the root folder. Then run:
```bash
dub run
```

You should see the output:

```bash
Running ./levenshtein-d
Levenshtein Distance: 3
```
